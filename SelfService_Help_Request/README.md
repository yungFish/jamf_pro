Jamf Pro scripts, Extension Attributes, and other assorted scripts related to MDM.

# Self Service ticketing system
Simple script to allow users to submit issues/help requests via Self Service. The script then populates an Extension Attribute which can be used to place the device into a smart group for dashboard display and/or email notifications and, for bonus points, as a scope exclusion to prevent users from submitting multiple incidents before the previous request has been cleared.
