# SelfService_Help_Request
Simple script to allow users to submit issues/help requests via Self Service. The script then populates an Extension Attribute which can be used to place the device into a smart group for dashboard display and/or email notifications and, for bonus points, as a scope exclusion to prevent users from submitting multiple incidents before the previous request has been cleared.

Obviously, a dedicated ticketing system would better allow you to track issues and requests but this may provide additional communication opportunities with advanced users or a testing group, for example.
