# SelfService_Help_Request
Simple script to allow users to submit issues/help requests via Self Service. The script populates an Extension Attribute which can be used to place the device into a smart group for dashboard display and/or email notification and, for bonus points, as a scope exclusion to prevent users from submitting multiple incidents before the previous request has been cleared.

This is by no means intended to replace a dedicated ticketing system but may provide additional communication opportunities with advanced users in a testing group, or for Field-Desktop-Techs logging in at Self Service, for example.
