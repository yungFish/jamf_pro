#
#	Huge credit and thanks go to github.com/kc9wwh and github.com/haircut for
#	their projects that served as this script's inspiration. This script was designed to
#	follow the exact same workflow as haircut's migrate-jss-client project but with this
#	updated script to make the API call to un-enroll the device (using the backbone of 
#	kc9wwh's script linked below).
#
#	For reference:
#		1. haircut 'migrate-jss-client' - https://github.com/haircut/migrate-jss-client
#		2. kc9wwh 'removeJamfProMDM' - https://github.com/kc9wwh/removeJamfProMDM
#
# 	To accomplish this the following will be performed:
#			- Attempt removal via Jamf binary
#			- Attempt removal via Jamf API sending an MDM UnmanageDevice command
#
# 	REQUIREMENTS:
#			- Jamf Pro
#			- Jamf Pro API User with permission to read computer objects
#			- Jamf Pro API User with permission to send management commands
#           		- Script must be executed as root (due to profiles command)
#
# 	EXIT CODES:
#			0 - Everything is Successful
#			1 - Unable to remove MDM Profile
