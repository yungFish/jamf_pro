# LDAP_Group_Membership

Jamf Pro Computer Extension Attribute that aims to find all LDAP groups (including nested groups) that the user assigned to the computer is a member of. Preliminary testing was only possible with a lightly populated directory - not many users or groups that those users could be a part of - so further tweaking is welcomed (and potentially necessary).
