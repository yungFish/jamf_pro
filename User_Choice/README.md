# User_Choice

Imagine the scenario where an organization forces their machines to require a password X seconds after the screen saver begins; lets use 15 seconds in this hypothetical example. Now further imagine this company has a user that maybe lives with a roommate they found on Craigslist (or don't fully trust for whatever other reason) and would like to set this value to 0 seconds for further security in their personal life. Here, the organizational default configuration profile forces the user into the '15 second' choice and doesn't allow them to change it even if they want to change that value to something that is more secure than what their organization requires.

With that, we can introduce our 'User choice' script that's made available as a policy in Self Service. The dialog box pops up, lets them hit the button for '0 seconds' (or cancel if they didn't mean to/decide they don't want to), then writes the 'Requested' value to an Extension Attribute created for this purpose. That EA value then puts the computer into a smart group which could be a scope exclusion for the default security configuration profile and would also be the scope target for the 'more secure' version of that payload.
